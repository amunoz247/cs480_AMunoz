## PA5: Assimp and Model Loading
In this project, we use Assimp (Asset Library) to load 3D models and display them onto the screen. For this project I worked with Robert Trimble and Zach Cooper. The working and complete program can be found in Robert Trimble's GitHub repository for the CS480 graphics course.
