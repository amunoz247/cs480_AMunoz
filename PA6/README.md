## Project 6: Assimp with Textures
This project uses Assimp to load models as well as textures for those models. We use the ImageMagick library to load the texture (.jpg) files into a format that can be read by OpenGL.
I worked on this project with my classmates Zach Cooper and Robert Trimble. The full program can be found in Robert Trimble's computer graphics repositories.
